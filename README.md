## Project Description
Note Taker is an application that allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. This helps keep track of tasks that need to be completed, along with staying organized. This application connects the front end to the back end by utilizing Express. When the user starts filling out the text fields, a save button is shown on the top right hand corner, which will allow you to save the note. Once that's done, the note will render on the left. A trash bin button is also generated, that allows the note to be deleted if needed. Take control of your life and ensure your tasks are completed in a timely manner!  

## Installation
Before running the application, the user must execute the command "npm install" to install all of the required dependencies and packages. You're now all set to run this application!

## Usage
To execute this application, you will open the directory where server.js resides. Once you're in the correct directory, then run the command "node server.js" in the terminal. This will connect you to the server. If at any point, you'd like to end the connection to the server, run the command "CTRL + C" Next, navigate to "localhost:5000" in your preferred browser. You're now taken to the home page where you may begin to create, save, and delete notes.
